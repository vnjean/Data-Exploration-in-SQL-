# Data Exploration in SQL - COVID-19 Dataset

## Introduction

This repository focuses on the exploration of COVID-19 data sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The dataset covers the period from January 3rd, 2020, to December 19, 2023, and includes a comprehensive set of information with 67 columns. The detailed documentation for the dataset can be found on the [Our World in Data GitHub](https://docs.owid.io/projects/covid/en/latest/dataset.html#additional-files-and-information).

## Data Processing

We downloaded the raw COVID-19 data in Excel format and subsequently split it into two distinct datasets: `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccinations`. These datasets were then uploaded to a SQL Server for further analysis.

## Dataset Overview

- **CovidDeaths Dataset:** Contains information related to COVID-19 deaths.
- **CovidVaccinations Dataset:** Focuses on COVID-19 vaccination data.

## Metrics Calculations

In this SQL Data Exploration, we performed various metrics calculations on the datasets. Some of the key analyses include:

1. [Mention specific metrics or calculations performed, e.g., Daily Death Rates, Vaccination Coverage, etc.]
2. [Add additional metrics or analyses as applicable.]

## Repository Structure

- `CovidDeaths.sql`: SQL queries and commands for exploring the CovidDeaths dataset.
- `CovidVaccinations.sql`: SQL queries and commands for exploring the CovidVaccinations dataset.
- `assets/`: Folder containing images or visualizations generated during the exploration.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vnjean/Data-Exploration-in-SQL-.git
   ```

2. Execute the SQL scripts in your SQL Server environment to replicate the analyses.

## Visualization

You can find visualizations or insights derived from the data exploration in the `assets/` folder, specifically [link to the visualization image](https://github.com/vnjean/Data-Exploration-in-SQL-/assets/67580325/fe9b9adf-2ab4-4c6b-9387-4ed5c31584a7).

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a comprehensive exploration of COVID-19 data using SQL. Feel free to explore the SQL scripts and visualizations to gain insights into the trends and patterns present in the dataset.
